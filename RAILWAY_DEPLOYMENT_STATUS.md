# 🚂 Railway Deployment Status

## ✅ **Progress So Far:**

1. ✅ Railway CLI installed
2. ✅ Logged in as: `madhudheeravath000@gmail.com`
3. ✅ Project created: **AI EDU**
4. ✅ Project URL: https://railway.com/project/2fcddef3-3ae3-4623-b6af-443b70e226a4
5. ⏳ **Currently deploying Python AI Detection service...**

---

## ⏳ **Current Status: Building**

Railway is building your Python service with these dependencies:
- FastAPI (web framework)
- PyTorch (AI model runtime)
- Transformers (GPT-2 model)
- Uvicorn (server)

**This takes 3-5 minutes** due to large dependencies (~2GB).

---

## 📊 **How to Monitor:**

### **Option 1: Railway Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Go to: https://railway.com/project/2fcddef3-3ae3-4623-b6af-443b70e226a4
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Watch the build logs in real-time

### **Option 2: CLI Status**
The CLI command is still running in your terminal. Wait for it to complete.

---

## ✅ **What Happens After Build Completes:**

1. **Railway generates a URL** for your Python service
   - Format: `https://your-service.up.railway.app`

2. **Test the service:**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-service-url.up.railway.app
   ```
   Should return:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "running",
     "service": "DetectGPT AI Detection",
     "version": "1.0.0"
   }
   ```

3. **Copy the URL** - You'll need it for Vercel

## 🔗 **Next Steps After Deployment:**

### **Step 1: Get Your Railway URL**

After deployment completes, Railway will show you the URL. It looks like:
```
https://ai-edu-xxxx.up.railway.app
```

Or get it from:
1. Railway Dashboard → Your Service → Settings → Domains
2. Click "Generate Domain"

### **Step 2: Add Railway URL to Vercel**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click "ai-edu-dashboard"
3. Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add:
   - **Name:** `DETECTGPT_SERVICE_URL`
   - **Value:** Your Railway URL (e.g., `https://ai-edu-xxxx.up.railway.app`)
5. Click "Save"
6. Go to Deployments → Click "..." → "Redeploy"

### **Step 3: Setup Database (Supabase)**

1. Go to: https://supabase.com
2. Create new project
3. Wait for database to initialize (~2 minutes)
4. Settings → Database → Connection String
5. Copy the "URI" connection string

### **Step 4: Add Database URL to Vercel**

1. Vercel Dashboard → ai-edu-dashboard
2. Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add:
   - **Name:** `DATABASE_URL`
   - **Value:** Your Supabase connection string
4. Add more variables:
   - **Name:** `NEXTAUTH_URL`
   - **Value:** `https://ai-edu-dashboard-lfhsiencm-madhuxx24-8951s-projects.vercel.app`
   - **Name:** `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
   - **Value:** Generate with: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"`
   - **Name:** `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** `YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY
5. Click "Save All"
6. Redeploy

### **Step 5: Initialize Database**

```bash
# Set DATABASE_URL to production
$env:DATABASE_URL="your-supabase-connection-string"

# Push schema
npx prisma db push

# Import data (optional)
node quick-restore-data.js
```

## ✅ **Deployment Checklist:**

- [x] Railway CLI installed
- [x] Logged into Railway
- [x] Railway project created
- [ ] Python service deployed (in progress)
- [ ] Railway URL obtained
- [ ] Database created on Supabase
- [ ] All environment variables added to Vercel
- [ ] Vercel app redeployed
- [ ] Database schema pushed
- [ ] App tested and working

---

## 📞 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If Railway build fails:**
- Check Railway dashboard logs
- Ensure `requirements.txt` exists
- Ensure `.railwayignore` excludes `venv/`

### **If Railway service won't start:**
- Check that `main.py` exists
- Ensure PORT is set (Railway sets this automatically)
- Check Railway logs for errors

### **To get Railway URL:**
```bash
# In your terminal
railway domain
```

Or from Railway Dashboard → Service → Settings → Domains → Generate Domain

---

## 🎯 **Estimated Time Remaining:**

- Railway build: ~2-3 more minutes
- Supabase setup: ~3 minutes
- Vercel configuration: ~2 minutes
- Database initialization: ~1 minute

**Total: ~10 minutes to full deployment**
